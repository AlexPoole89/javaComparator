Your task is to read in data from input.txt and instantiate appropraite classes either Teacher or Student with the correct data.
Parsing the file must be done line by line.
If a line is invalid (too may/too few data items, invalid data, etc.) you must display a warning and continue parsing to the next line.
Add every created object of Teacher or Student to an ArrayList<Person>.

You need to add constructors, getters and possibly setters (not required, since no values are changed ever).
Constructors and setters must throw a custom InvalidDataException exception if data is invalid.

Operations of main() method:
1. Read in the file and add items to the list
2. Loop over the list and using Printable interface print each item's data.
3. Sort the list using Comparable by name
4. Loop over the list and using Printable interface print each item's data.
5. Sort the list using Comparator by age
6. Loop over the list and using Printable interface print each item's data.
